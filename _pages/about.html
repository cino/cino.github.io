    <h1>Hello, I'm Ricardo!</h1>
    <p class="intro-paragraph">My name is Ricardo <strong>Cino</strong>, I'm a Developer from the Netherlands with my main focus around web-applications. </p>

    <p>
        Where to start, I've been interested in web development since around 2005 where I first met HTML in an after-school-program. This was actually around the time we all still used software like frontpage and dreamweaver to make beautifull html websites. Soon after this I discovered a real editor like Notepad++ and the <del>terror</del> fun of programming began.
    </p>
    <p>
        Fast forward 10 years, it's 2015 and working for my first development job! Putting the skills I've learned on the side to good use, at this time my main language had been shifted to PHP and this turned out to be the language I'd stick with for a long time. Up till this day most of the applications (small and large) have been built in PHP in different frameworks.
    </p>
    <p>
        My interest of purely programming back-end software started to change when I met AWS in around 2017. This felt huge. It first started with the small stuff, just running an application on EC2 with a RDS backend but soon after we "needed" to use Lambda which ofcourse I didn't mind looking into. This is just the tip of the iceberg when thinking about the projects I've worked on while using AWS, there isn't a single project in the last 3 years that doesn't use Amazon Web Serivces. Working that much with AWS motivated to get some certifications, which I'll list below (<small><i>because I need to flex</i></small>) :
        <ol>
            <li>Amazon Web Services Cloud Practitioner</li>
            <li>AWS Certified Developer – Associate</li>
            <li>AWS Certified SysOps Administrator – Associate</li>
            <li>AWS Certified Solutions Architect – Associate</li>
            <li>AWS Certified DevOps Engineer – Professional</li>
        </ol>
        <small>Can be verified on: <a href="https://www.credly.com/users/ricardo-cino/badges">Credly</a></small>
    </p>
    <p>
        I can safely say I'm intrested in archieving all AWS Certifications as there is lots and lots more to learn.

        This is a brief introduction to who I am, or at least what I am interested in. There is a 100% chance that I will update this page at least a 100 times because it's quite strange to write these things about yourself.
