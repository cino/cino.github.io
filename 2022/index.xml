&lt;p>To this day I still think this role shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be used at all, but rather be deleted by Amazon itself. While I agree that Amazon wants people to get started as quickly as possible it is not in line with the least access principle. For this reason, I always define the role myself, for starters only allowing the Lambda function to write to its own CloudWatch Log Group. There is no reason for the Lambda function to be able to write to log groups of other services rather than its own.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Building a Serverless Kanban Board</title><link>https://cino.io/2022/building-a-serverless-kanban-board/</link><pubDate>Mon, 18 Apr 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cino.io/2022/building-a-serverless-kanban-board/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;strong>Update 18/01/2023: Let&amp;rsquo;s assume this is not gonna happen anymore&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As the title suggests I&amp;rsquo;m planning on building a Serverless Kanban Board to improve my personal Typescript skills in both the front and back end. Furthermore, the whole project will be set up while using Amazon Web Services (of course ðŸ˜‰)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I thought it would be fun to build something for practice and also have some personal projects on my GitHub page that display the latest techniques I&amp;rsquo;m working with and as a bonus get some material I can write about on the website!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>TIL #1 - You can override basically anything in AWS CDK</title><link>https://cino.io/2022/you-can-override-basically-anything-in-aws-cdk/</link><pubDate>Sun, 03 Apr 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cino.io/2022/you-can-override-basically-anything-in-aws-cdk/</guid><description>&lt;p>Unique as I am I decided to start writing short blog posts about recent discoveries that suddenly clicked inside my head. For the first one; I have been working a lot with AWS CDK recently and decided that I wanted to contribute back to the AWS-CDK source code.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Temporarily working on a Windows Laptop</title><link>https://cino.io/2022/temporarily-working-on-a-windows-laptop/</link><pubDate>Sun, 13 Mar 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cino.io/2022/temporarily-working-on-a-windows-laptop/</guid><description>&lt;p>This has been quite the struggle, for the last 6 years, I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on a Macbook Pro/Air (m1) and right now I&amp;rsquo;m not able to do so. Due to a recent job change, I&amp;rsquo;m working on a Windows laptop until the new Macbook is in. At first, I was really curious to work on Windows again! I&amp;rsquo;ve been talking Microsoft up anytime I spoke with somebody about the company, the recent acquiries, the change in direction, I really like where the company is going.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Deploying your static website with a Github Action</title><link>https://cino.io/2022/deploying-your-static-website/</link><pubDate>Fri, 18 Feb 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cino.io/2022/deploying-your-static-website/</guid><description>&lt;p>Authenticate GitHub with OpenID Connect to deploy your CDK project to your AWS Organization&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After making an AWS CDK project one of the first thing you will realize is that you don&amp;rsquo;t want to keep running cdk deploy to update your production environment. This is a fine way of working when you modify your personal dev environment as it is a quick way of deploying but definitely not for your staging/production environments.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Static website distribution with AWS CloudFront</title><link>https://cino.io/2022/static-website-distribution-with-aws-cloudfront/</link><pubDate>Fri, 11 Feb 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cino.io/2022/static-website-distribution-with-aws-cloudfront/</guid><description>&lt;p>Having only written about PHP and Servers in the past I am making the switch to Serverless. This has been a long-time wish for me and finally realized this in a personal but also professional environment. That being said, I plan on writing a lot of new content on the blog purely around setting up applications with a serverless mindset, built with AWS CDK (AWS Cloud Development Kit). I will include diagrams and/or flowcharts to explain what is happening and of course, include the source code in a public GitHub repository.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The bigger goal for me is to develop a proper application on nothing but serverless services from Amazon to train my skillset and also share the process that I went through.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
