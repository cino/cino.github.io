      <description>&lt;p&gt;Recently I&amp;rsquo;ve been using AWS Secrets to retrieve API keys which are needed to access external API&amp;rsquo;s, however, this turned out to be a more expensive service than we initially thought when starting.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s been almost a year since I&amp;rsquo;ve started using my YubiKey, even though I only recently bought a backup key (yes, you can shame me) I decided it is time to have big write up on why you should be using a hardware key with Fido2(WebAuthn) support too.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Besides the AWS Certification program, there are also the newer AWS Learning skill badges. A new-ish way of learning the skills necessary to work on the aws platform and illustrate your knowledge. These are like the certifications except they are &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; certifications of some kind and you can take exams to receive the &amp;ldquo;Skill badge&amp;rdquo;, this is all for free and is here to help you. I finished them all and wanted to highlight each of them, and how I experienced each of the exams.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Almost a year ago I visited an AWS User Group (Amsterdam) meetup where someone gave a presentation on using Microsoft &lt;a href=&#34;https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers&#34;&gt;Dev Containers&lt;/a&gt; in your projects. Even though I tried it before, this gave me the momentum to actually commit to it and have never looked back. And I want you to do the same.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
