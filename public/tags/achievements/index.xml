      <description>&lt;p&gt;Besides the AWS Certification program, there are also the newer AWS Learning skill badges. A new-ish way of learning the skills necessary to work on the aws platform and illustrate your knowledge. These are like the certifications except they are &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; certifications of some kind and you can take exams to receive the &amp;ldquo;Skill badge&amp;rdquo;, this is all for free and is here to help you. I finished them all and wanted to highlight each of them, and how I experienced each of the exams.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
