      <title>Private API Gateway with DNS</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;At PostNL we are building most of our applications with &lt;a href=&#34;https://medium.com/postnl-engineering/business-overview-f7c8d8ebee2c&#34;&gt;Serverless&lt;/a&gt; in mind, let me rephrase that, we build all our applications within our own landing zone with Serverless only. There is no option to deploy any kind of EC2 and if you need containers you&amp;rsquo;d be running them on Fargate only.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Given that, we are using quite a bunch of API Gateways in the projects I&amp;rsquo;m working on. While PostNL is also a big corporate company we have a strong focus on security and compliance, and that&amp;rsquo;s why we are building our applications &lt;strong&gt;Private first&lt;/strong&gt;. When there is no need to be public, it shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>TIL #3 - AWS CloudShell in your own vpc</title>
      <link>https://cino.io/2024/aws-cloudshell-in-your-own-vpc/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Until recently, I was completely unaware of &lt;a href=&#34;https://aws.amazon.com/cloudshell/&#34;&gt;AWS CloudShell&lt;/a&gt;, and I&amp;rsquo;m glad I finally decided to give it a try. CloudShell provides a shell environment right in your browser, and to my surprise, you can start an instance within your own VPC!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Avoiding CloudFormation Stack Outputs</title>
      <link>https://cino.io/2024/avoid-cloudformation-stack-outputs/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Recently I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on a new project where we created many resources in a lot of different stacks. A feature of CloudFormation is that you can output values from your stack, which is great for referencing resources in other stacks. However, while there is a use-case for this, I&amp;rsquo;ve found that it&amp;rsquo;s better to avoid using these outputs and instead use SSM parameters.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;When working with AWS CDK and using SSM Parameters to store information in between stacks there are multiple ways to retrieve the value, with both advantages and disadvantages. In this post, I&amp;rsquo;ll go over the different ways to retrieve SSM parameters in AWS CDK and when to use them.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>AWS Parameter Store vs AWS Secrets</title>
      <link>https://cino.io/2023/aws-parameter-store-vs-aws-secrets/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Recently I&amp;rsquo;ve been using AWS Secrets to retrieve API keys which are needed to access external API&amp;rsquo;s, however, this turned out to be a more expensive service than we initially thought when starting.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Besides the AWS Certification program, there are also the newer AWS Learning skill badges. A new-ish way of learning the skills necessary to work on the aws platform and illustrate your knowledge. These are like the certifications except they are &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; certifications of some kind and you can take exams to receive the &amp;ldquo;Skill badge&amp;rdquo;, this is all for free and is here to help you. I finished them all and wanted to highlight each of them, and how I experienced each of the exams.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
