Ah, we are back! Once again, this will be the third try of starting and actually updating a personal blog. I'm not exactly sure what I wrote down the last time but I'm planning the same.

Alright, let me explain again. I once had the idea of putting my random thoughts about anything tech related just out there, which means the subjects of this blog can be quite diverse.

If you just stumbled across this website and you're thinking, who is this guy? Check out the <a href="/about">about me</a> page where I wrote a little bit about me and will try to update if anything changes.
