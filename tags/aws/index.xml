&lt;p>To this day I still think this role shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be used at all, but rather be deleted by Amazon itself. While I agree that Amazon wants people to get started as quickly as possible it is not in line with the least access principle. For this reason, I always define the role myself, for starters only allowing the Lambda function to write to its own CloudWatch Log Group. There is no reason for the Lambda function to be able to write to log groups of other services rather than its own.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Building a Serverless Kanban Board</title><link>http://example.com/posts/building-a-serverless-kanban-board/</link><pubDate>Mon, 18 Apr 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://example.com/posts/building-a-serverless-kanban-board/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;strong>Update 18/01/2023: Let&amp;rsquo;s assume this is not gonna happen anymore&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As the title suggests I&amp;rsquo;m planning on building a Serverless Kanban Board to improve my personal Typescript skills in both the front and back end. Furthermore, the whole project will be set up while using Amazon Web Services (of course ðŸ˜‰)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I thought it would be fun to build something for practice and also have some personal projects on my GitHub page that display the latest techniques I&amp;rsquo;m working with and as a bonus get some material I can write about on the website!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Static website distribution with AWS CloudFront</title><link>http://example.com/posts/static-website-distribution-with-aws-cloudfront/</link><pubDate>Fri, 11 Feb 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://example.com/posts/static-website-distribution-with-aws-cloudfront/</guid><description>&lt;p>Having only written about PHP and Servers in the past I am making the switch to Serverless. This has been a long-time wish for me and finally realized this in a personal but also professional environment. That being said, I plan on writing a lot of new content on the blog purely around setting up applications with a serverless mindset, built with AWS CDK (AWS Cloud Development Kit). I will include diagrams and/or flowcharts to explain what is happening and of course, include the source code in a public GitHub repository.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The bigger goal for me is to develop a proper application on nothing but serverless services from Amazon to train my skillset and also share the process that I went through.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
