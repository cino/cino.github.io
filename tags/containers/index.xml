One of the biggest challenges was to create a private AppSync API with a custom domain. This is something that is not natively supported by AWS, but it is possible to achieve it using a combination of services.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>While this is now possible for API Gateway, AppSync is a different beast. There is no native way to create a private AppSync API with a private custom domain. This is something that I had to figure out the hard way, and I want to share my findings with you.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This might become a bit of a long read, but if you are looking for a way to create a private AppSync API with a custom domain, you are in the right place. I will try to explain the steps I took to achieve this and the challenges I faced along the way.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
