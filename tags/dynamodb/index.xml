The truth is that DynamoDB Streams have a maximum retention period of 24 hours and there is no way to extend that. When you do need more than 24 hours the default solution is to use Kinesis Data Streams, which can retain data for up to &lt;a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/streams/latest/dev/kinesis-extended-retention.html"&gt;365 days&lt;/a&gt;. While it would be easy to just move to Kinesis, this comes with extra cost which may not be justified for all use cases.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Modifying DynamoDB TTL with CDK</title><link>https://cino.io/2025/modifying-dynamodb-ttl-with-cdk/</link><pubDate>Sat, 22 Mar 2025 12:00:40 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://cino.io/2025/modifying-dynamodb-ttl-with-cdk/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Ever tried to update the TTL attribute of a DynamoDB table using the AWS CDK and got a &lt;code&gt;InvalidRequest&lt;/code&gt; in CDK or a &lt;code&gt;ValidationException&lt;/code&gt; via the CLI? I did, and it took me a while to figure out why. In this post, I&amp;rsquo;ll explain what happened and how to avoid the same issue in the future. This is a short post, but I think it&amp;rsquo;s worth sharing because it can save you some time and frustration.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
