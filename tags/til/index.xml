For the first one; I have been working a lot with AWS CDK recently and decided that I wanted to contribute back to the AWS-CDK source code.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For this reason, I spent quite some time within the Issues section of the AWS-CDK &lt;a href="https://github.com/aws/aws-cdk">Github Repository&lt;/a> and learned that a lot of feature requests are requests for adding a property to a construct that isn&amp;rsquo;t supported yet, while these are actually supported in CloudFormation. Which would make them easy pull requests to work on.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is where I first found a comment about using an &lt;a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/v1/guide/cfn_layer.html">Escape Hatch&lt;/a>, which enables you to modify the underlying CloudFormation template while working with the CDK project.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I never really thought much about using an Escape Hatch as I never needed one, however as I said at the beginning of this post it suddenly &amp;ldquo;clicked&amp;rdquo; in my brain. Because the Escape Hatch enables you every feature that CloudFormation already has thus provides you always a way to accomplish your task.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>While this feature exists, I would always suggest trying to improve the CDK with a feature request or a pull request to enable the feature you are missing.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
