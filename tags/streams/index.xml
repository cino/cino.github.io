The truth is that DynamoDB Streams have a maximum retention period of 24 hours and there is no way to extend that. When you do need more than 24 hours the default solution is to use Kinesis Data Streams, which can retain data for up to &lt;a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/streams/latest/dev/kinesis-extended-retention.html"&gt;365 days&lt;/a&gt;. While it would be easy to just move to Kinesis, this comes with extra cost which may not be justified for all use cases.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
