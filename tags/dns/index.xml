There is no option to deploy any kind of EC2 and if you need containers you&amp;rsquo;d be running them on Fargate only.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Given that, we are using quite a bunch of API Gateways in the projects I&amp;rsquo;m working on. While PostNL is also a big corporate company we have a strong focus on security and compliance, and that&amp;rsquo;s why we are building our applications &lt;strong>Private first&lt;/strong>. When there is no need to be public, it shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
