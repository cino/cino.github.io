&lt;p>At PostNL we are building most of our applications with &lt;a href="https://medium.com/postnl-engineering/business-overview-f7c8d8ebee2c">Serverless&lt;/a> in mind, let me rephrase that, we build all our applications within our own landing zone with Serverless only. There is no option to deploy any kind of EC2 and if you need containers you&amp;rsquo;d be running them on Fargate only.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>AWS CloudShell in your own vpc</title><link>https://cino.io/2024/aws-cloudshell-in-your-own-vpc/</link><pubDate>Tue, 12 Nov 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cino.io/2024/aws-cloudshell-in-your-own-vpc/</guid><description>&lt;p>Until recently, I was completely unaware of &lt;a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cloudshell/">AWS CloudShell&lt;/a>, and I&amp;rsquo;m glad I finally decided to give it a try.

A feature of CloudFormation is that you can output values from your stack, which is great for referencing resources in other stacks. However, while there is a use-case for this, I&amp;rsquo;ve found that it&amp;rsquo;s better to avoid using these outputs and instead use SSM parameters.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Multiple ways to retrieve SSM parameters in AWS CDK</title><link>https://cino.io/2024/multiple-ways-to-retrieve-ssm-parameters-cdk/</link><pubDate>Sun, 10 Nov 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cino.io/2024/multiple-ways-to-retrieve-ssm-parameters-cdk/</guid><description>&lt;p>When working with AWS CDK and using SSM Parameters to store information in between stacks there are multiple ways to retrieve the value, with both advantages and disadvantages.
