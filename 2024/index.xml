There is no option to deploy any kind of EC2 and if you need containers you&amp;rsquo;d be running them on Fargate only.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Given that, we are using quite a bunch of API Gateways in the projects I&amp;rsquo;m working on. While PostNL is also a big corporate company we have a strong focus on security and compliance, and that&amp;rsquo;s why we are building our applications &lt;strong>Private first&lt;/strong>.

A feature of CloudFormation is that you can output values from your stack, which is great for referencing resources in other stacks. However, while there is a use-case for this, I&amp;rsquo;ve found that it&amp;rsquo;s better to avoid using these outputs and instead use SSM parameters.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Multiple ways to retrieve SSM parameters in AWS CDK</title><link>https://cino.io/2024/multiple-ways-to-retrieve-ssm-parameters-cdk/</link><pubDate>Sun, 10 Nov 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cino.io/2024/multiple-ways-to-retrieve-ssm-parameters-cdk/</guid><description>&lt;p>When working with AWS CDK and using SSM Parameters to store information in between stacks there are multiple ways to retrieve the value, with both advantages and disadvantages. In this post, I&amp;rsquo;ll go over the different ways to retrieve SSM parameters in AWS CDK and when to use them.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
